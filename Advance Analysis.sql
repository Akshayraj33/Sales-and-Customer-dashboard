SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName
FROM customers c
WHERE c.CustomerID NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID
  FROM orders
  WHERE OrderDate >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 months'

ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

-- 12. Daily revenue trend analysis
SELECT CAST(OrderDate AS DATE) AS order_day, SUM(OrderAmount) AS daily_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_day
ORDER BY order_day;

-- 13. Forecasting next monthâ€™s revenue using historical averages

  FROM orders
  GROUP BY month
) AS monthly_data;

-- 14. Customer segmentation: Average order amount by age group
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN Age < 25 THEN 'Under 25'
